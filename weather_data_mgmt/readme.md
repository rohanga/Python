Weather Data Management Project

Project Setup

This project is a Django application designed to manage weather data. To set it up on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- `venv` package for virtual environment creation

### Setup Instructions

Create a Virtual Environment**
   	Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then run:

   	```bash
   	python3 -m venv <virtual_env_name>

Activate the Virtual Environment

On macOS/Linux:
Bash
Copy code
source <virtual_env_name>/bin/activate

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
project_name\Scripts\activate
Create a Django Project

Setup Database Connection

In the settings.py file, change the database configuration to PostgreSQL:
Use pgAdmin or the terminal to create a new database

Running the Project

Run Migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Start the server with: python manage.py runserver

Access the Project
Open your browser and go to:

Data Ingestion
Assumptions:
We are provided with multiple text files containing records of day-wise temperatures.
Each fileâ€™s data belongs to one of the five states provided in the problem statement.
We assume that starting five letters of each file form a unique state code. Remaining characters of filename form the station, of which the records have been provided.

To load data into the database, I have created a management command
Run the management command to load data:
python manage.py load_weather_data
This management command reads every txt file, loads the file content in a dataframe making it easier to operate on data. Based on the filename, I derived the state and station that this file belongs to. Based on these parameters, I created a list of records to be inserted in the weather data.
Then, I called the bulk creation method on the django model to reduce the total number of database hits, making efficient insertion of large data.


REST APIS
Fetch weather data
Endpoint - /weatherdata/
Query params
Start: starting index for pagination
End: end index for pagination
Station_id: Fetch stationwise data across all states
State: Fetch statewise data
Date: Fetch datewise data across all states and stations
Fetch statistics data
Endpoint - /stats/
Query params
Station_id: Filter stats only for a particular station id
Year: Fetch stats only for input year
State: Fetch stats only for state
Save statistics data
Endpoint: /calculatestats/
This will make an entry in the stats table, storing average max temperature, average min temperature and total precipitation for every station across all states
